# MSFS C152X Realism Mod
V0.10


## Installation
Place the "C152X" folder in your community package folder.

### 0.10
Some of the current improvements (not exhaustive):
- Modified stall speeds flap up/flap down in accordance with published information.  Aircraft will now stall at a significantly higher speed.
- Numerous changes to engine performance, now in accordance with Lycoming O-235L2C (115HP, 2700RPM) See note below.
- Fuel consumption adjusted.
- Long Range Fuel Tanks 37.5USG total useable. See note below.
- Fuel Gauges correctly calibrated.
- Fuel Gauge indications will vary realistically in out of balance flight (depending on quantity of fuel in tank) and also on the ground when the aircraft is not wings level.
- Flight tested to verify climb, cruise, service ceiling, fuel consumption etc in accordance with published information.
- Oil Temperature Gauge - gauge calibration and oil temperature modelling adjusted.
- Oil Pressure Gauge - gauge calibration and oil pressure modelling adjusted.
- Electrical system - completely remodelled, using documented electrical loads etc.
- Now models realistic battery discharge/charge and subsequent electrical system behaviour. 
- If battery goes flat, various systems will fail at various voltage levels as the battery discharges.
- Ammeter - gauge calibration and behaviour.
- Low voltage light now comes on below ~ 1000 RPM as in real life.
- OAT thermometer now operates regardless of the position of the master switch.

# Notes:  
 - The default aircraft panel has a Tachometer with a 2700RPM redline.  As a result I have taken the decision to model the C152 with the corresponding and slightly uprated 115HP engine.  (It is essentially the same engine as the 'standard' C152 Lycoming engine with 110HP/2550RPM redline, with a few extra horsepower from the additional RPM.  The standard cruise performance chart power settigns etc will still be valid. The extra horsepower means slightly better takeoff and goaround performance and a slightly higher service ceiling.  The current version tested in the sim has a service ceiling around 15,500ft.)
 - The default aircraft panel depicted fuel gauges for Long Range Tanks (37.5USG) but the sim data was for Short Range Tanks (24.5USG useable). Again I have taken the decision to model the Long Range Tanks.  This gives the aircraft a nearly 9 hour endurance and a range of up to 670 nm.  This makes the aircraft much more capable of long range flights in the sim, and I think much more useful.  (Round the world type flight capability. :))
